# Express.js Mini Web Project

## 📖 Description

This project is a simple web application built using **Express.js** and **EJS**. It demonstrates the use of REST API methods (**GET**, **POST**, **PATCH**, **DELETE**) to manage a catalog of items. The application provides a user-friendly interface for listing, adding, editing, and deleting items while ensuring each item has a unique identifier using **UUID**.

## 🔑 Features

### 1. **GET**
- Retrieve and display all items in the catalog.
- View detailed information for individual items.

### 2. **POST**
- Add new items to the catalog.

### 3. **PATCH**
- Edit and update details of existing items.

### 4. **DELETE**
- Remove items from the catalog.
